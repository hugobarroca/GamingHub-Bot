# GamingHub-Bot

GamingHubBot is a basic bot created for usage within my own discord server. Currently it supports changing roles over text commands and reactions.

Currently accepted commands:

**!help:** Displays this informative message.  
**!ping:** Respondes with a pong to confirm online status.  
**!permittedroles:** Lists all the roles that you can add or remove from yourself with this bot.  
**!addrole {role}:** Adds specified role to the user. Use quotations marks for roles with spaces.  
**!removerole {role}:** Removes specified role from the user. Use quotations marks for roles with spaces.  
**!weeb:** Gives you a random anime quote.
